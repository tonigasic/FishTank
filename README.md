# FishTank
I made this application in order to keep track of the fishes in my aquarium. It is made using ASP.NET Core MVC with Entity Framework Core.

### Welcoming page

Contains some basic info about the most fishkeeping and types of aquarium. Also includes links to pages that explains all that much better!
